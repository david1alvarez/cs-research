    # the pivot, while j points to the element of the list that is being assessed. When an instance is found such that arr[i]
    # is less than or equal to the pivot, swap it for the arr[i+1] value, and move i up to point to that new value. Effectively 
    # iterating through the list with an upper and lower index bounds, and whenever the upper index bound finds a value less 
    # than or equal to the pivot, place it where the lower bound is, and move the lower bound up. This process ensures that at
    # the end of the list, all elements that are equal to or lower than the pivot will be safely at or behind the lower index bound.
    # Once that is the case, swap the pivot with the element that is one above i, ensuring that all elements equal to or lower than
    # the pivot will be to the left of it, and all elements greater than it will be to the right of it. The order of those domains
    # doesnt matter, as the point of the partitioning is to find the sorted index of the pivot.
    # Partitioning in this way also mutates the array, so we can use the new somewhat-sorted array in our next iterations.
